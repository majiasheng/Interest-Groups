But that division isn't very adequate today - there are also many different categorizations or \"interdisciplinary\" subdisciplines which each span over many or all traditional subdisciplines, such as theoretical chemistry, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, colloid chemistry, nanochemistry, chemical biology (which is actually more chemistry than biochemistry is), structural chemistry..."}
